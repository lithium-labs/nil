# Short Description
Nil is a blazingly fast and small cache cleaner made in Rust.

# How to Use
Nil requires a config file called `rules.txt` or a `templates/` folder (structure: [templates](templates/)) in the same directory as the executable to function.<br>
The format is defined in the [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) file.
